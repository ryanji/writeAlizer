# writeAlizer: An R Package to Generate Automated Writing Quality and Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) Scores

This repository hosts code for a R package to apply research-based writing scoring models (see references below). In addition, this repository hosts documentation as an electronic supplement to published research articles in the repository wiki.

The writeAlizer R package (a) imports [ReaderBench](https://git.readerbench.com/ReaderBench/ReaderBench), [Coh-Metrix](http://cohmetrix.com/), and GAMET output files into R, (b) downloads existing predictive scoring models to the local machine, and (c) uses the predictive scoring models to generate predicted writing quality scores or Correct Word Sequences and Correct Minus Incorrect Word Sequences scores from the ReaderBench, Coh-Metrix, and/or GAMET files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
